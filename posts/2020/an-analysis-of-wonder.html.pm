◊lead-in{What is it to wonder?}
 I'm going to defend an analysis 
that I think might be right:
to wonder is to want to know.
This should be of interest especially to epistemologists,
given wondering's central role in inquiry.◊note{There seems
				to be something of
				an inquisitive turn going on
				in epistemology, continuing a rich
				tradition that goes back to Plato
				and Aristotle.  See, e.g., recent
				papers by Jane Friedman 
((2013) "◊link["https://doi.org/10.1111/phpe.12026" #:ext 1]{Question-directed attitudes}",
(2017) "◊link["https://doi.org/10.1111/nous.12137" #:ext 1]{Why Suspend Judging?},

◊section{Why Analyze?}

Before getting into the analysis,  a quick
methodological preamble.
I agree with those who think epistemologists shouldn't
get too hung up on finding analyses of the various states and
relations they are interested in: knowledge, belief, 
evidence, etc.◊note{E.g.,
Williamson (2000) ◊i{Knowledge and Its Limits}  and 
Pasnau (2017) ◊i{After Certainty}.} What we really want are good
descriptive and normative theories of these things, or
whatever things in the ballpark turn out to be most
interesting or important. And we shouldn't presume 
that the good theories will make significant use of
reductive analyses. Fortunately, most epistemology going
on these days doesn't presume this, and doesn't focus
too much on finding analyses.

But this isn't to say that if there ◊emph{is} some
true reductive analysis involving important epistemic notions
that it isn't worth knowing.
Analyses make for nice theoretical
connective tissue, letting you port over independently motivated
views
about the
analyzing notions to the analyzed one and vice versa. They also at
least give you the option of claiming a kind of parsimony:
Defined Thing, you might say, just is Defining Thing, so 
we no longer need to treat these as separate ontological 
commitments.
Or if you prefer lush to arid landscapes, you
have the option of saying that we have given a real definition,
revealing something's essence. Analyses aren't the end-all, 
be-all, nor are they necessary preliminaries to theorizing,
but they're good if you
can get it's ’em.


◊;It is in this spirit I offer the analysis of wonder.

◊section{The Analysis}
Okay, so here it is:
◊blockquote{◊header{◊b{WTK Theory of Wonder}}
	◊div[#:style"text-align:center"]{S wonders Q iff S wants to know Q.
	}}

For instance, I want to know who will win the election, 
so it follows that I wonder who will win the election.
I wonder how many degrees of warming there will be 
this century, so I must want to know how many degrees
of warming
there will be this century.
It's not the case that I want to know exactly how many blades of grass
there are in the nearby park, so that's not something I wonder.
And I don't wonder
whether it's raining in Topeka, so it must be that
it's not the case that I want to know whether it's raining in Topeka.

Results so plausible as to seem trivial. Perhaps
this is why no philosophers have defended this analysis.◊note{As
far as I know. Please tell me if I'm missing some
literature on this. Note also that some
linguists---◊link["https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00351935" #:ext 1]{Kartunnen (1977)},
◊link["https://doi.org/10.1007/s10988-007-9014-x" #:ext 1]{Guerzoni and Sharvit (2007)}---have
suggested a semantics for wonder along these lines. ◊link["https://doi.org/10.1093/jos/ffv009" #:ext 1]{Uegaki (2016)}
argues that on this analysis, plus some assumptions about
◊i{want}’s presuppositions and their projection,
one can explain why we can't say that someone wonders ◊i{that p}.
This is a cool result, but 
see ◊link["https://doi.org/10.1007/s11050-019-09152-9" #:ext 1]{Theiler,
Roelofsen, & Aloni (2019, §A.2)}
for reasons to think
this won't generalize to other clause-embedding predicates
that don't take declaratives. They also raise a problem to do
with presupposition
projection which I might address at some later date.}
But in fact the analysis is inadequate as it stands.
We need to get clearer on what kind of wanting is involved,
which will help us avoid some apparent problems for the
analysis. We also need to deal with a problem about metacognition.

◊section{What-things-considered?}

Here's a class of potential counterexamples: sometimes
we find ourselves wondering something when we don't
◊i{really} want to know. Suppose you're wondering 
how many years you have left to live. But you also think
that if you could somehow know the answer to this, it
would cast such a pall over the rest of your life
that any benefits to knowing would be outweighed. If
someone offered you a glimpse into the crystal ball,
you would turn it down, because you
don't want to know. Nevertheless, you could still
be wondering how many years you have left to live.
So it looks like we have wondering without wanting to
know.
Another analysis bites the dust, it seems.

Not so fast! ◊i{Distinguo:} all-things-considered wanting
	and some-things-considered wanting. 

Suppose 
you invite me to play tennis on Tuesday at 2:00.
I would really enjoy this, need the exercise,
	and would be happy to have an excuse
to catch up, but I'm scheduled to teach at that time.
As Wayne Davis points out,◊note{Davis (1984) 
"◊link["https://www.jstor.org/stable/4319662" #:ext 1]{The Two
Senses of Desire}": p. 239.} I can truly describe my mental
state in a pair of contrasting ways:
◊ul{
◊li{"I want to play, but I have to teach."}
◊li{"I don't want to play, since I have teach."}
}

The former reports that I ◊i{some-things-considered} want
to play, whereas the latter reports that I ◊i{all-things-considered}
want not to play.

This distinction allows us to avoid the counterexample.
Wondering, we should say, is wanting to know some-things-considered.
When you wonder when you will die, you want to know some-things-considered,
even if all-things-considered you'd rather not know.
That seems right to 
me.


◊section{Activity}

Here's another concern about the WTK Theory.◊note{Friedman (2013, p. 154) 
objects along these lines. Thanks also to Zoltán Szabó for raising it
in conversation.} The verb ◊i{to wonder}
seems to express an activity, whereas ◊i{to want to know}
expresses a state. They have different aspectual classes.◊note{For a classic division of verbs
(or really, verb phrases) by aspectual class,
see Zeno Vendler (1967) ◊i{Linguistics in
Philosophy}: Ch. 4.}

One mark distinguishing these classes of verbs is
that statives don't take well to the progressive,
whereas non-statives do. 
Picture a scene:
your friend is sitting at their desk, pulling
the Thinker pose.  Contrast the following as descriptions
of what's going on.
◊ul{
◊li{"They're thinking that expressivism might be true."}
◊li{ "They're believing that expressivism might be true."}
}
The latter sounds terrible! 
This is because ◊i{believe} is a stative verb, in contrast
with ◊i{think}, which is non-stative. Belief is a state you can
be in, whereas thinking is some kind of activity---something
that happens.

Now let's try this test for ◊i{wonder}
	and ◊i{want}.
◊ul{
◊li{"They're wondering whether expressivism can make sense of normative
inquiry."}
◊li{"They're wanting to know whether expressivism can make sense of
normative inquiry."}
}
Again, the latter sounds terrible! It seems that ◊i{want} is a
stative verb and ◊i{wonder} is not. Desire is a state you can
be in, whereas wondering is some kind of activity---something
that happens.

This looks bad for the WTK Theory of Wonder.
A successful analysis of wonder will have to identify wonder
not with a state like desire, but with something non-stative, some
kind of activity
or happening.

Here's one alternative proposal: trying to find out. This gets many
normal cases right. When I'm wondering what I should cook
for dinner, I am trying to find out what I should cook for 
dinner by thinking through what ingredients I have, how 
long various options would take and how much effort they
would involve. And it's not easy to think of cases where
one is trying to find something out but doesn't wonder the
relevant question.

That said, I don't think it gets all the
cases right. It has trouble, first of all,
with the merely some-things-considered
wanting to know cases. You can be wondering when you
will die while purposefully ◊i{not} trying to find
out the answer to that.
Second, it has trouble with cases of wondering what you
realize you'll never know. I sometimes wonder what Mozart
would have composed had he not died young, but I've never
tried to find out, since it's so transparently hopeless.


I think a better way to go here preserves the WTK theory, again by
making a distinction between types of wanting. Distinguish, as
Goldman does,◊note{Goldman attributes the distinction to Alston, but no
doubt it goes back further, in some form or other.}
between ◊i{occurrent} and ◊i{non-occurrent} 
wants. Here's how he introduces the distinction:
◊blockquote{
John is concentrating on finishing the lawn by six o'clock.
He is giving all his attention to mowing it as quickly as 
possible, with the thought of getting it done by six. During this
period, whether it be a few seconds or a whole minute, John has
an ◊i{occurrent} want to finish mowing the lawn by six o'clock.
The thought of finishing the lawn by six ◊i{occurs} to hum, occupies
his attention, fills his consciousness. It is a datable event or 
process. During the same period it would also be correct to say
that John wanted to be president of his company. But his wanting
to be president of the company is not an ◊i{occurrent} want during
this time, for John has not been thinking about the company or his
future at the company. Nevertheless, we could say that John wants
to be president of his company because he has a ◊i{disposition} to
have occurrent wants to this effect, and this disposition is present while
John is mowing the lawn, though it is not being manifested. I shall
say that John has a ◊i{standing} want to be president of his company.
◊footer{Alvin Goldman (1970, p. 86) ◊br{} ◊i{A Theory of Human Action}}
}
Pinning down what precisely this distinction amounts to is no
easy task,◊note{See Bartlett (2018) "◊link["https://doi.org/10.1080/00455091.2017.1323531" #:ext 1]{Occurrent States}" 
for one recent attempt.}
but I take it to be clear enough as is for my purposes.
Note that this kind of want is not just a philosopher's postulate.
We do have words for at least some such wanting events. In
English:
longings, cravings, hankerings, lustings, yearnings.
It would be a bit over the top to say that
John was yearning to finish mowing the lawn, but it is something
that could be said if he wanted it badly enough (and perhaps
met some other conditions required for yearning).

What's important is that there is a kind of wanting that is
a "datable event or process", a non-stative kind of thing. We
can naturally use the progressive here.
John is occurrently wanting to finish mowing the lawn by six,
craving chocolate cake, etc.

We can solve the non-stative problem for the WTK Theory,
then, by saying that the kind of wanting it identifies 
wondering with is occurrent
wanting. To wonder is to occurrently want to know.
Modulo the exaggeration and other connotations, we might say
it is to crave or yearn for knowledge.

Besides getting the non-stative-ness right, this
also works for the merely-some-things-considered and
the hopeless wondering cases. Craving something but not
wanting it all-things-considered is very familiar,
as is yearning for what you know will not happen.

◊section{Why knowledge?}

I've spent all this time talking about the kind of
wanting involved in wondering, but what it is supposed
to be a want for?
Why think it's knowledge?
To be honest, this is mainly just a hunch. There are various
alternatives worth considering.

Maybe all
we want is belief, as Peirce claims.◊note{Peirce (1877)
"◊link["http://www.peirce.org/writings/p107.html" #:ext 1]{Fixation 
of Belief}": §IV. Peirce is talking about 'doubt', but
it seems to me that he has wondering in mind.}
Or maybe true belief,
or justified true belief, or stable credence, or rational
stable credence, or some other non-knowledge-entailing state.
But I don't think so.
Peirce observes that one stops wondering
once one has settled one's opinion into a belief.
But one also stops yearning for what one mistakenly believes
one has attained. 
The desire is not satisfied in such cases,
but merely dissipates. This is what strikes me as going
on in cases where one stops wondering but doesn't know.


This is not yet a substantive argument against these other
options,
but I suspect one can be given (maybe in another post, if
I can think of an interesting one). 

I'm less confident that the object of a wondering
desire shouldn't be taken
to be something something that entails knowledge, but
involves more. Perhaps wondering Q is wanting to learn Q or to find
out Q. The usual way one goes from not knowing to knowing is through
learning or finding out, so it wouldn't be surprising if most
cases of wanting to know also involve wanting to learn or find out.
But it does seem possible to come to know without learning or finding
out.
Sci-fi examples
come to mind: one may come to know through some kind of direct
uploading
without learning or finding out. I will leave trying
to figure out if one's
wondering is satisfied or merely dissipated in such cases to 
another time. Perhaps in the end we should favor the WTF (Want To
Find out) over the WTK Theory.

These are still cases
of coming to know through coming to have a belief. Another way
one might come to know without learning is going from having a
belief that is not justified to one that is, or going from 
Getteried justified true belief to un-Getteried justified
true belief. It's somewhat unclear
whether one can really want to undergo such a change, for Moorean
Paradox-ish reasons, but if one can
I  suspect we wouldn't want to call it wondering.
If so, I think the WTK theory can handle this with appeal to some
form of contrastivism. Something like wanting
to know Q as opposed to remaining
in suspended judgement about Q.


For now, then, I'm inclined to accept something along the lines
of
◊blockquote{◊header{◊b{WTK Theory of Wonder (elaborated)}}
	◊div{
S wonders Q iff S occurrently,
some-things-considered
wants to know Q rather than
remain in suspended judgement about Q.
}}


◊section{Metacognition Without Cognitive Concepts}

One more potential counterexample.
If Samson the puppy◊note{◊(img #:style "max-width:85%" #:src "samson.jpg")}
		lacks the concept of knowledge
(plausible), he can't have attitudes towards contents about knowledge.
So he can't have desires about knowledge. So he can't, e.g.,
want to know stuff. But he does seem to wonder.
He wonders what made that sound, which is why he's going to
the other room.
But apparently he can't want to know
what made that sound. So wondering can't be wanting to know.

More generally it seems that we're comfortable describing 
various non-human animals as wondering, but we wouldn't
be so comfortable ascribing to them
a concept of knowledge. Such creatures lack the capacity for
metacognition, and so must lack the capacity for metacognitive
desires. So wondering can't be a metacognitive desire like 
wanting to know.◊note{Friedman (2013, §3) makes this argument,
as does Carruthers (2018) "◊link["https://doi.org/10.1111/mila.12167" #:ext 1]{Basic Questions}".
	Whitcomb (2010) "◊link["https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00394.x" #:ext 1]{Curiosity was Framed}" makes the
	same point about curiosity, building on Kvanvig (2003) 
	◊i{The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding:} pp. 143ff.}

Attributing to non-human animals mental states with particular
contents is fraught with philosophical difficulty, so I'm 
not confident what the best view is here. However,
I'm unpersuaded that the analysis is refuted.

One reason I'm unpersuaded stems from how I myself feel about the 
cases. In most contexts, I'm totally happy
to say that Samson does want to know what made that sound.
"Why's Samson trying to go there?" "He wants to know what 
made that sound." This just seems true to me.

Does that mean I think he possesses the concept
◊small-caps{knowledge}? Well, if all that's meant by
that is that he can, e.g., want to know what made that sound,
then sure. But if something more robust is meant, then
maybe not.

In other contexts---like ones where philosophical
issues about animals' mental states are raised---I admit
I am hesitate to say he
really wants to know what made that sound. But in those
same contexts I'm similarly hesitant to say he wonders what made that
sound. Regardless 
of context, answering the question about why Samson is
going to the other room with "He wants to know
what made that sound" seems about equally objectionable
as
"He wonders what made that sound".
This is as the WTK Theory would predict.

The other reason I'm not persuaded is more theoretical.
I think there are good
reasons to think that at least some
kinds of metacognition are less cognitively demanding than
the skeptics make it out to be, and that
Samson and other non-human wonderers ◊i{do} 
represent their own knowledge states in some of their goal
representations. But that gets into issues
about psychosemantics 
best left for their own post. 

In the meantime, email me if you've got other counterexamples to the
WTK Theory of Wonder. ◊end{}
