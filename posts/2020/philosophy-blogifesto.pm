◊lead-in{More philosophy online, please!}
The web would be better with more philosophy on it and
philosophy would be better with more of it on the web. 


Sure, the journals are already online, even if most
are ludicrously
paywalled.◊note{Props to the Open Access exceptions:

◊link["https://semprag.org/index.php/sp"]{S&P}, and
◊link["https://philpapers.org/journals/pubs.pl?listId=14954&journals=1"]{others}!}
	A lot of books are available online too, 
		one way or another.
And of course there are the wonderful EPs: the
◊link["https://plato.stanford.edu/"]{SEP} and
◊link["https://iep.utm.edu/"]{IEP}.
Reading all the great philosophy already online
would take more time than anyone has. 

But it can take years to get an idea out to readers in these
professionally vetted forms, and to do so one needs to package
it in just the right way to satisfy---in the eyes
of reviewers and editors---a variety of
constraints:  concision, clarity,
rigor, scholarliness,
originality, 'relevance', and
 word limits.

Besides, many ideas that
people should  be able to read and discuss online
simply are not publishable in these places: 
the half-baked, the politically opinionated,
the minor nit-pick, the non-critical notice,
the unargued synoptic vision, the reading list,
the cool paragraph you just came across in some
obscure place, etc.

Finally, sometimes one just doesn't feel like reading stuff
that has passed through this wringer, you know?
Scholarliness, rigor, and the rest is
 important for certain purposes,
but sometimes one just feels like getting
some philosophy that's rougher, punchier,  sillier, smaller,
grander, or
more personal than what typically gets into the academic
journals.◊note{I'm not being original in 
 complaining about academic publishing in these
 ways. See Agnes Callard's 
◊link["https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/publish-and-perish-agnes-callard/"]{recent article in ◊i{The Point}} for one recent
entry in the genre.
I'm sympathetic to some of what she
says there, but also think she underestimates the ambition,
	quality, and depth of recent work relative 
	to the older stuff.}


I think this is part of what's attractive about reading
the great (and even the not so great) philosophers of the past: they
had their own constraints, but not the same
ones we have. Lack of the constraints is also
part of what's great about talking philosophy with friends
in a pub, department lounge, or wherever.
But opportunities for that are limited,
especially these days.
 

Luckily, there are many other possibilities for doing
philosophy online.
Blogs and microblogs; vlogs, video essays, and streams;
podcasts and microcasts;
newsletters, wikis, interactive tutorials, forums, webcomics,
	webzines, and online books. You can put online your
reading notes, lecture notes, teaching ideas, 
article ideas, ideas too small for articles, ideas
too big for articles,
book reviews,
lit reviews, interviews, and link dumps. 
Scholarly or slap-dash, many times revised
or first pass outlines, any style under the sun. 
Public philosophy, deep-in-the-arcane-weeds philosophy,
and everything in between. 

There's a lot of philosophy online in most of these forms too, but I wish
there was more of it, from a wider range of philosophers.

Okay, sure, why not?

This is my new philosophy blog. 

I'd be happy if you too would start a philosophy blog (or whatever 
other kind of online philosophy thing).
Tell me about it so I can check it out and maybe talk about it here.
One thing I hope to regularly do here is talk about what's
going on philosophy-wise elsewhere online.

◊p[#:style "text-align: right;"]{
◊emph{"
Why not just post on Twitter or Facebook
or Medium or ...?"}} 

As this is a blogifesto, it is fitting to have
some high-minded numbered
principles to which I solemnly commit myself.

They
are:

◊ol[#:style "font-variant: small-caps"]{
◊li{◊emph{No distracting ads or nagware.}}
◊li{◊emph{No invasive surveillance.}}
◊li{◊emph{No volunteering control of my content 
to some corporation for use in algorithms that manipulate
people into addictive scrolling and clicking and posting  in order
to generate more revenue from distracting ads targeted with invasive
surveillance.}}
}

There's a lot of fun and interesting philosophy talk
on Twitter (and, I assume, on Facebook), 
but it seems to me that on balance these platforms make the internet and
the world worse. Given their profit models, I don't expect
them to improve. So we should work towards better alternatives. 
Blogging from my own website is my small contribution.
